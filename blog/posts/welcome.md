# Welcome to Datus Blog

We're excited to launch the Datus blog! This is where we'll share insights, tutorials, and updates about AI-native data engineering.

## What is Datus?

**Datus** is an open-source data engineering agent that builds **evolvable context** for your data systems. Unlike traditional tools that merely move data, Datus captures, learns, and evolves the knowledge surrounding your data—transforming metadata, reference SQL, semantic models, and metrics into a living knowledge base.

## What to Expect

On this blog, you'll find:

### 🎯 Technical Deep Dives
- How context engineering improves data quality
- Building intelligent subagents for data tasks
- Best practices for AI-native data workflows

### 📊 Case Studies
- Real-world implementations
- Performance benchmarks
- Migration stories from traditional tools

### 🚀 Product Updates
- New feature announcements
- Release notes and roadmap
- Community highlights

### 🎓 Tutorials
- Getting started guides
- Advanced configuration tips
- Integration examples

## Join the Journey

Datus is more than a tool—it's a new paradigm for data engineering. We're building a community of data engineers who believe that context, not just code, is the key to scalable analytics.
